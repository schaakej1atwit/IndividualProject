# IndividualProject
My Project analyzes online retail customer behavior using a dataset of transaction-level data. My goal was to explore how features like spending habits, membership level, discount usage, and recency of purchase to relate to customer satisfaction. Methods included heatmaps, K-Means, and exploratory visualizations. Two additional datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau were used to provide context through national e-commerce sales trends and Q4 2024 sector performance. The results support actionable insights for e-commerce strategy, particularly around segmentation and targeting.
